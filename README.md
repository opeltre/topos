# Topos

## Installation 

The only requirement should be pytorch: `pip install torch`.

Then clone the repository locally to start using the library. 

## Usage 

### Systems 

System instances describe collections of variables (vertices) 
along with their allowed joint measurements (cells or regions). 
The number of states `N["i"]` for each variable `"i"` is 2 by default.

A system can for example be a graph (all regions are pairs) 
or a higher dimensional instance, called a [hypergraph][hypergraph]. 
For generalized belief propagation (GBP) to run well,
the underlying hypergraph should be closed under intersection (default). 

```py
K = System(("i:j:k", "j:k:l", "i:k:l")), close=True)
```

When a `System` instance is created, all inclusions relations 
are computed to yield the [nerve][nerve] of the hypergraph: 

```py
>>> K[2]
Domain {"(i:j:k) > (j:k) > (k)", "(i:j:k) > (i:k) > (k)", ...}
```

A collection of topological and combinatorial operators 
are moreover computed, acting on fields. 

### Fields 

A 0-Field `u` is a collection of tensors indexed by regions 
such that `u[a]` is a function on the state of 
variables in the region `a` 
(that is, a d-dimensional tensor when a is of size d)

```py
>>> K[0].zeros() 
0 Field {
    (j:k) :: [[.0, .0], [.0, .0]],
    ...
    (k)   ;; [.0, .0]
}
```

A 1-Field `phi` is a collection of tensors indexed by 1-chains 
such that `phi[a > b]` is a function on the state of variables in `b`. 

```py 
>>> K[1].ones()
1 Field {
    (i:j:k) > (j:k) :: [[1., 1.], [1., 1.]],
    ...
    (j:k) > (k)     :: [1., 1.]
}
```

See also `K[i].randn()`. 

TODO: `__setitem__` and other initializers (dict, lambdas...)

### Operators  

There are a collection of natural operators acting on such
statistical systems, revealing a rich interplay with topology and
and combinatorics. 

These include (implemented)
- a differential operator `K.d[k]` from k-fields to (k+1)-fields
- a codifferential operator `K.delta[k+1] from (k+1)-fields to k-fields
- the zeta transform `K.zeta[k]` acting on k-fields
- the MÃ¶bius transform `K.mu[k]` inverting `K.zeta[k]`
- the Gibbs state map `K[k].gibbs` mapping fields to local probabilities
- the effective energy gradient `K.Deff` from 0-fields to 1-fields
- its tangent map `K.nabla(p)` at a consistent belief `p`. 

## Example: belief network on graphs

See [example.py](example.py)

```py
>>> K = System(("i:j", "j:k"))

>>> u = K[0].randn()
>>> u
0 Field {

(i:j) ::       [[-1.6016,  0.6941],
                [-0.2367, -0.1504]],

(j:k) ::       [[ 0.3672, -0.0543],
                [ 0.7570, -0.0231]],

(j) ::       [0.5114, 0.5331],

}

>>> d
1 Linear d

>>> d(u)
1 Field {

(i:j) > (j) ::       [ 2.3497, -0.0106],

(j:k) > (j) ::       [ 0.1985, -0.2008],

}
```
